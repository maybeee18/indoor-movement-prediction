## Dataset Description
### Summary
This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living applications. The binary classification task consists in predicting the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN).

Input data contains temporal streams of radio signal strength (RSS) measured between the nodes of a WSN, comprising 5 sensors: 4 anchors deployed in the environment and 1 mote worn by the user. Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset, the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-1,1], singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor.

Target data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular, the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements, while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.

The measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings, each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided by the Figure in file **MovementAAL.jpg**.

Each file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences, for a total number of 13197 steps. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Indoor+User+Movement+Prediction+from+RSS+data).

### Attribute Information
Data is provided in comma separated value (csv) format.

* **Input:** Input RSS streams are provided in files named **MovementAAL_RSS_SEQID.csv**. Here, *IDSEQ* is the progressive numeric *sequence ID*. In each file, each row corresponds to a time step measurement (in temporal order) and contains the following information:
*RSS_anchor1, RSS_anchor2, RSS_anchor3, RSS_anchor4*.

* **Target:** Target data is provided in the file **MovementAAL_target.csv**. Here, each row in this file contains:
*sequence_ID*, *class_label*.

* **Dataset Grouping:** Data is grouped in 3 sets. File **MovementAAL_DatasetGroup.csv**, provides information about such data grouping. Each row in this file contains:
*sequence_ID*, *dataset_ID*.

* **Path Grouping:** Users' movements are divided in 6 prototypical paths. File **MovementAAL_Paths.csv** provides information about data grouping based on path type. Here, each row in this file contains:
*sequence_ID*, *path_ID*.
